Get and Clean Data Project for AFL Player Stats

The purpose of this project is to produce a clean dataset of AFL Player Statistics. The intent is this could then be used for further exploratory projects such as predicting outcomes based on prior player performance against opposition, at the same venue or just on recent form.

The dataset will be intended to include mainly current players and only over the last 3 years or so, however it is expected this project could easily be expanded to include a much longer history if somebody else would like to.

The main reference for the data is the public information hosted at the AFL statis tics URL: http://afltables.com/afl/afl_index.html

Current commit as of Jan 10 is a full set of stats for all players, all teams and all rounds including finals for season 2015.
